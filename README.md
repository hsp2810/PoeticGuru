### What is this repository for? ###

Repositry basically consists the code of my personal project called PoeticGuru. It is basically a web application
that will be regularly updated with Hindi Poems, quotes and stories.

My very good friend Parth Patel is a very good writer. When I read his poems I was really impressed and thought this content 
should reach more and more people.
